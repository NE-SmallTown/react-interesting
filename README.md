### Let's go through each one and figure out which one is state. Simply ask three questions about each piece of data:

- Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn't state.
- Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn't state.
- Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn't state.
